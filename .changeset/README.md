# Changesets

This directory was generated to help manage versioning and publishing for this monorepo using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

Common commands (run from repository root):

- `npm run changeset` – create a new changeset interactively.
- `npm run version` – apply all pending changesets to bump versions and update changelogs.
- `npm run release` – publish packages to npm (non-private packages).

Configuration is stored in `.changeset/config.json`.
